# linear-regresssion-with-one-feature
ML (linear regression algorithm)
This is the first algorithm in ML in which we are trying to best fit a straight line to the given data and can obtain approximate value of
y for the given x(dependent variable).In real life there are many features(i.e x) but for the simplicity i have taken only single feature.
This code computes cost function, gradient descent for minimizing the theta and according to that theta plotting a approximate graph.
